There's no arguing that the current coronavirus pandemic has changed the world drastically. With so many new norms, we have witnessed how the internet has helped people in this pandemic. It would have never been possible for many people to continue their job or education without the internet. However, not every person has used internet ethically. For cybercriminals, this appears to be an opportunity to take advantage of businesses while they make this virtual shift.

We have seen hackers using the internet to misguide people and damage organisations financially. The number of phishing attacks during this pandemic has risen quite significantly. We have seen large numbers of phishing and spear-phishing emails over time. Not only phishing, but the reports suggest that there has been an increase in all kinds of cyberattacks since March 2020. However, most began via phishing.

One main reason for the increase in phishing attacks is the usage of video conferencing tools. People have shifted their meetings, classes, and workshops to these video conferencing tools, and we have seen a considerable number of people registering their accounts on the platforms. A recent report has found 1700 zoom related domains registered in the last three weeks. At least 4% of them are suspicious and possibly malicious. This is because people have been working remotely and telecommuting through these platforms, including skype, zoom, google meet, and similar other platforms.

The most common way of phishing attack that hackers have adapted is that they use the fake zoom domains to create fake Covid themed emails. Those who respond to these emails are downloading malicious software. If not the software, they are somehow compromising their data to the hackers. 

Here's a template we offer to protect your business from Zoom related phishing attempts:

What is more concerning is that this is not all. There are many other ways in which hackers are trying to trick people. According to the Australian Cyber Security Centre report, on average, 4400 crime cases are getting reported a month. We have seen hackers creating Banking themed SMS phishing campaigns, spoofing the government in email phishing campaigns, and even economic stimulus payment phishing emails. With so many cases being reported in recent times, people need to educate themselves about these sorts of frauds. 

The key is to pay attention to the little details, and you will manage to figure out whether the email or call is legit or just a scam. Even if you find something suspicious, don't hesitate to report it to the cybercrime department.

There are a few tips that you can follow to protect yourself from being a victim of phishing simulations and phishing emails. Always read the message very carefully. Look for any errors in the spellings, numbers, names, or URLs. If you are on a PC or laptop, you can hover your mouse over the link and can check if the URL is legit or not. This way, you will save yourself from visiting the URL and compromising all your data and details. You can also Google the sender address or subject line to see if anyone has already reported it as malicious.
