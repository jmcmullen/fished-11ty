## What Are Phishing Attacks?

Phishing attacks are a type of cyberattack in which an attacker sends an email or other communication that appears to be from a reputable source, such as a bank, government agency, or online retailer. The message will typically ask the recipient to click on a link or provide personal information, such as login credentials or credit card numbers.

Phishing attacks can be highly sophisticated and convincing, often using social engineering tactics to trick the recipient into providing sensitive information.
