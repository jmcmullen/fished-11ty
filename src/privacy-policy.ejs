    <h4>What is Personal Information and why do we collect it?</h4>
    <p>
      Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual. Examples of
      Personal Information we collect include: names, addresses, email addresses, phone and mobile
      numbers.
    </p>

      We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of providing our services to you,
      providing information to our clients and marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also use your Personal Information for secondary purposes closely related to the
      primary purpose, in circumstances where you would reasonably expect such use or disclosure.

    </p>

      When we collect Personal Information we will, where appropriate and where possible, explain to
      you why we are collecting the information and how we plan to use it.
    </p>

    <h4>Third Parties</h4>
    <p>
      Where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect your Personal Information only from
      you. However, in some circumstances we may be provided with information by third parties. In
      such a case we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of the information

    <h4>Security and storage of Personal Information</h4>

    <p>
      We have specific measures in place to manage the security of your data and risk management
      including contractual obligations with third party providers and audit and monitoring of

      we will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your Personal Information.
